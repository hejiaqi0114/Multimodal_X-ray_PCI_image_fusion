## Introduction
This repository intends to collect or implement image fusion techniques for multimodal X-ray phase contrast imaging in literatures


* An great overview of general image fusion techniques [in repo](https://github.com/Linfeng-Tang/Image-Fusion)
* A review on multimodal medical image fusion: compendious analysis of medical modalities, multimodal databases, fusion techniques and quality metrics. (2022) 
* Multi-scale image fusion for X-ray grating-based mammography.(2012) [paper](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/8506/1/Multi-scale-image-fusion-for-x-ray-grating-based-mammography/10.1117/12.929625.short)
* Image fusion scheme for differential phase contrast mammography. (2013)[paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/8/07/C07011)
